## Project Structure

```
SRM-GPA-CALCULATOR/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main HTML file with the UI
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js          # JavaScript logic for GPA & CGPA calculation
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css         # Styling for the application
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Project documentation
```

## How It Works

- **JavaScript (`script.js`)** contains the logic:
  - Maps grades to grade points.
  - Dynamically creates input rows for courses and semesters.
  - Calculates GPA by weighted average of grade points and credits.
  - Calculates CGPA by weighted average of semester GPAs and credits.
  - Validates inputs and shows alerts for missing or invalid data.
  
- **HTML (`index.html`)** provides the structure and forms for user input.

- **CSS (`styles.css`)** styles the app with a clean, professional look and responsive design.
